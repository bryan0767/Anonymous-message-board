Talk about things, be a thing at the sandwich shop!

Start a new thread by creating a sub, choose your sub's shop name and a password 
to delete in case you hate your lame opinions later. 

Reply to existing subs and teach somebody something they didn't know if your something 
hadn't something'd their something. 

Search for existing subs on the front page, top 7 recently created are listed. 

Delete a sub with ID Number, sub name, and password.

Shout out to MongoDB on the backend, Express for the routing, and CSS, were still not friends.

Hopeful additions if time were to allow: 

Multiple pages for sub searching on front page.
search for shops as well.
make shops the star of the show by storing subs inside 
each new shop and querying shop data instead of individual sub data.
